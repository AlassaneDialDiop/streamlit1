You are given a link to an ALDO product, either shoe or handbag and the link to its main image in the catalog.

The purpose of the task I am asking you here is to make sure the product receives a color label that makes sense for a customer seeing the product on the website and wondering which color label makes more sense for the product.
Just focus on the images you will identify following the instructions I give you. Ignore of the text in the webpage.

Your task is to search in the webpage the 4 images that have in their URLs the text ‘main_sq’ , the text ‘alt1_sq’, the text ‘alt2_sq’ and the text ‘alt3_sq’. Once you have those images, apply some alterations to the images and then determine the appropriate color label for the product according to each image.
Include in your answer the color label based on each image and then make a final decision for what is the appropriate label to assign to the product on the website. 
Verify that the urls you include in your answer work fine and we can load the images using a browser like Google chrome with a public account.


Here are 10 color labels that can be assigned to the product 'Beige', Blue, 'Black', 'Brown', 'Green', Purple', 'Pink/Red', 'Silver/Grey', 'White', 'Yellow/Gold'.
A 11th option is here whenever the color label isn’t obvious, as there might be more than one color in the altered images.  This 11th option is called ‘Multi’.
You have to return one of these 11 options in your answer. 
If ‘main_sq’, ‘alt1’ , ‘alt2’ , ‘alt3’ don’t give the same color label then just assign ‘Mutli’ as the final color label to select.

The alterations to apply to the image should mirror the way it is done in Adobe Photoshop CS6.
The list of the alteration to apply is the following:
1. Remove the background and only keep the image of the product.
2. Decrease the saturation of the purple color range by 60% and increase the saturation of the green color range by 60%.
3. Increase the value of the yellow color range by 60% and decrease the magenta and cyan color ranges by 60% for the color balance adjustment.

Here is the link to the product webpage.
<<<productpage>>>
Here is the link to its main image in the catalog.
<<<productmainimage>>>


You will use the link to the main image in the catalog to determine the links to the images ‘alt1’, ‘alt2’, and ‘alt3’
